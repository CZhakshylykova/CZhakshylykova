## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Molecular Biologist and Medical Student with a passion for data-driven discovery. My foundation in molecular science and medicine gives me a unique perspective on transforming complex biological questions into actionable data solutions.

I have hands-on experience in experimental design, data collection, and scientific analysis. I enjoy building end-to-end data science projectsâ€”from data cleaning and visualization to statistical modeling and the clear communication of results. I'm especially interested in making complex findings and statistical models accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.
